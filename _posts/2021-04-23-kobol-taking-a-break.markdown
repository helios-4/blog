It's been 3 months since we posted on our blog. While we have been pretty active on [Armbian/Kobol forum](https://forum.armbian.com/forum/51-helios64/) for support and still working at improving the software support and stability, we have been developing in parallel the **new iteration of Helios64 around the latest Rockchip SoC RK3568.**

However things haven't been progressing as fast as we would have wished. Looking back, 2020 has been a very challenging year to deliver a new product and it took quite a toll on the small team we are. Our energy level is a bit low and we still haven't really recovered. Now with electronic part prices surge and crazy lead time, it's even harder to have business visibility in an already challenging market.

In light of the above, we decided to go on **a full break for the next 2 months**, to recharge our battery away from Kobol and come back with a refocused strategy and pumped up energy.

Until we are back, we hope you will understand that communication on the different channels (blog, wiki, forum, support email) will be kept to a minimum for the next 2 months.

**Thanks again all for your support.**
