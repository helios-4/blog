First of all Happy 2021 to all of you. Looking back at 2020, we are very thankful for the continuous support we got from all of you during that difficult year. Needless to say we are crossing our fingers that 2021 will bring a brighter horizon to all.

# Batch 1 Stock

We just added around 40 units for sales on our shop. These units have the manual rework already done for the [1G speed mode issue](https://blog.kobol.io/2020/11/13/helios64-2-5g-ethernet-issue/) on the 2.5GbE interface.

Since shipping fees world wide have still increased and this is a small stock, we decided to limit these units to a handful of countries for which we can still offer the same shipping terms than before.

* Belgium
* Czech Republic
* France
* Germany
* Hungary
* Italy
* Netherlands
* Poland
* Portugal
* Spain

Shipping mode : AIR, Delivered Duty Paid

Delivery Time : 2-3 weeks.

Shipping cost : USD77 (includes Duties and Taxes for Europe) per unit.

# Future Batches

We received thousands of inquiries asking when the next Helios64 batch will be coming up. We need a bit more time to refine our schedule before announcing our roadmap, but some exciting news coming up ;-)

# New Armbian Release

A new major update for Armbian will be released in the coming weeks. This will introduce new Linux Kernel 5.10. But more importantly, we  managed to fix a recurrent issue with the USB driver that impacted the stability of the 2.5GbE interface on Linux Kernel 5.x version.

This new release will also introduce ZFS v2.0.1 DKMS package that will now support Debian Stretch. Stay tuned to know when the new Armbian release is available for download / upgrade.
